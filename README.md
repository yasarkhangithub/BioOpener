###Introduction
The genomics era has led to great improvements in the understanding of the importance of personalised/precision medicine and novel drug discovery methods. The BIOOPENER project targets key challenges in understanding the disease of genome (i.e., cancer) are:

- Discovering specific gene mutations for various cancer types.

- Discovering pathways causing promoter changes in various cancer types.

- Discovering associations between selected genetic features to drug-like bioactive compounds.

- Discovering Protein Protein Interaction Networks (PPIs) and their implications.

The objective is to understand the tumorigenesis of various cancer types. The genetic and epigenetic changes are accumulated overtime transforming the normal tissue into invasive carcinoma.
